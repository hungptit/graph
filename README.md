# graph
This is a basic graph library that uses Column Sparse Row (CSR) format to store the graph information. graph provides below features:
* Written using modern C++ features.
* Provide very fast serialization/deserialization functionality using cereal and leveldb. graph can output or display the data in different data format such as JSON or XML.
* Provide implementation for some basic graph algorithms such as DFS, BFS, connected components etc.
